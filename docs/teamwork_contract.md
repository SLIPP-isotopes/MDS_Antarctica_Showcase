# Teamwork Contract
*Authors: Daniel Cairns, Jakob Thoms, Shirley Zhang*

## Expectations and Ground Rules

All group members will contribute their best efforts to ensure the project's success. We will endeavor to distribute the work evenly while taking into consideration each member's preferences and skillset. All members collectively hold the responsibility to ensure our deliverables are correct and complete, even if they did not personally work on them.

Group members will communicate openly about progress and any struggles, and we will support each other when they come up.
