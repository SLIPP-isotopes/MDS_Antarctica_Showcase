ABSTRACT={Numerical weather and climate simulations nowadays produce terabytes of data, and the data volume continues to increase rapidly since an increase in resolution greatly benefits the simulation of weather and climate. In practice, however, data is often available at lower resolution only, for which there are many practical reasons, such as data coarsening to meet memory constraints, limited computational resources, favoring multiple low-resolution ensemble simulations over few high-resolution simulations, as well as limits of sensing instruments in observations. In order to enable a more insightful analysis, we investigate the capabilities of neural networks to reconstruct high-resolution data from given low-resolution simulations. For this, we phrase the data reconstruction as a super-resolution problem from multiple data sources, tailored toward meteorological and climatological data. We therefore investigate supervised machine learning using multiple deep convolutional neural network architectures to test the limits of data reconstruction for various spatial and temporal resolutions, low-frequent and high-frequent input data, and the generalization to numerical and observed data. Once such downscaling networks are trained, they serve two purposes: First, legacy low-resolution simulations can be downscaled to reconstruct high-resolution detail. Second, past observations that have been taken at lower resolutions can be increased to higher resolutions, opening new analysis possibilities. For the downscaling of high-frequent fields like precipitation, we show that error-predicting networks are far less suitable than deconvolutional neural networks due to the poor learning performance. We demonstrate that deep convolutional downscaling has the potential to become a building block of modern weather and climate analysis in both research and operational forecasting, and show that the ideal choice of the network architecture depends on the type of data to predict, i.e., there is no single best architecture for all variables.}

The conceptual framework of Bayesian modelling for time-series data is discussed and the foundations of Bayesian non-parametric modelling presented for Gaussian processes. We discuss how domain knowledge influences design of the Gaussian process models and provide case examples to highlight the approaches. }

  abstract = 	 {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.}

Our approach combines an application programing interface (API) inspired by pandas with the Common Data Model for self-described scientific data. Key features of the xarray package include label-based indexing and arithmetic, interoperability with the core scientific Python packages (e.g., pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), out-of-core computation on datasets that don’t fit into memory, a wide range of serialization and input/output (I/O) options, and advanced multi-dimensional data manipulation tools such as group-by and resampling. xarray, as a data model and analytics toolkit, has been widely adopted in the geoscience community but is also used more broadly for multi-dimensional data analysis in physics, machine learning and finance.},
